A simple HTTP API to generate URI QR codes in SVG format


Click the following butto

## Manual deploy

```
git clone https://github.com/orestes/uri-qr-generator.git
cd uri-qr-generator
npm install
node index.js
```

If everything's working correctly, you'll get the following message:

```
uri-qr-generator is now listening on port 8080
```

## Configuration

If they're present, we make use of the following environment variables:

| Variable   | Setting                                                         | Default |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| PORT       | Where the HTTP server should listen.                            | `8080`  |
| PARAM_NAME | The `GET` param name containing the URI to encode as a QR Code. | `uri`   |
| URI_PREFIX | A prefix prepended to the all the URIs                          | *empty* |

## Usage

Make an `HTTP GET` request to `https://server:port/?uri=https:%2F%2Fsome-server/a/b`. The response is a QR Code in SVG format. This is the QR encoded representation of the `https://some-server/a/b` URI.

Remember to correctly encode `GET` params.

### Embeddeding QR codes as HTML images

Since we're using GET params, we can use the request URI as an image source, which be cached by browsers, proxies, etc...

If your `PORT` parameter is set to `80` (the default HTTP port in browsers), you can skip the port when using the images

`<img src="https://server/?uri=https:%2F%2Fsome-server/a/b" alt="https://some-server/a/b" />`

### Anti-abuse configuration

Unless you protect your API (by proxying through some other HTTP server, for example), anyone making requests to your service could be generating QR codes for free using your resources.

A typical use case is generating QR codes for a single domain name. Set your **URI_PREFIX** to `"https://my-domain"` and then pass relative URLs in your `GET` param values. Since every QR code will now start with your domain name, your service won't be useful for anyone else.

You should also rename the GET param to `path` so the API requests are more clear:

Now, `http://server:port/?path=/a/b` will return a QR Code in SVG format, pointing to `https://my-domain/a/b`

## Troubleshooting

Make sure the HTTP port (*default: 8080*) is not in use by some other process and/or change the HTTP port in the configuration. In some operating systems, you cannot listen on ports under 1000 without root permissions.
